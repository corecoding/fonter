Well here is my big whoppen TODO list.  Neato eh?

o  I plan to make this program fully NCURSES compatable in the future.
   Right now, it pretty much depends on ANSI control codes...

o  Make the font editor window use background colors for the block instead
   of actual characters, because, well it would just be better :)

o  Enable support for different formats of saving, .com, .h, etc.

o  Fix the (i) information problem, when in something other than 80x25.

o  Fix the (2) loading command with filenames with spaces
