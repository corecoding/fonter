Please note that the F1 command to save in pcf format is
not really setup correctly right now.  Now, it saves a vga.pcf
file, with the name vga inside.  You can change the filename,
or edit the file with a good editor, such as vi or vim, and
change the identifier.  That way, you could use it in X,
without overwriting your current vga.pcf.  Please note that
the identifier inside vga.pcf will only support 3 characters.
