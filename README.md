Fonter v1.8 - The new generation of font manipulation.  Since there were
  basically no universal font editors out there for linux (I only found two),
  I decided to write this one.  I hope that all the deluxe features that this
  program offers, help you to create some fantastic console fonts.  Let me
  stress that this is my FIRST C program of any OS.  So if the code is hard to
  read, or what have you, please do not tell me about it.  This program is
  modeled almost exactly the same as my MS-DOS font editor, which I created
  some time ago.  If you would like a copy of it, please email me.  The only
  code that I semi copied was from the setfont source.  I had to look
  at that code to figure out how the ioctl commands work to change the console
  font.  There is  *NO WARRANTY* with this program btw..  Which means I am in no
  way responsable for anything that happens.

  If you have any questions, please contact me via GitHub.

  For installation, just type 'make' and enjoy.  This program currently does
  not support 'make install', which it most likely will in the future.  Sorry
  :(.

  Please read the files in the docs/ directory also.  At least read the COPYRIGHT
  and FONT_CREDITS file.  Thank you.  If you don't read those files, it will not 
  protect you in any way.

Happy Fonting,
Chris
